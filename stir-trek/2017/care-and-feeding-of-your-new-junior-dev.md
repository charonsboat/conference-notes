# care and feeding of your new junior dev

## background

- everyone comes from a different background
- we have all gotten to this point in different ways
    - college (2 yrs, 4 yrs, more?)
    - bootcamp
    - self-taught
    - career switch
- we don't all learn or do things the same way

## communication

- we have to work hard at communication

## pair programming

- key to helping junior devs learn and grow
- the person learning should be the person driving
    - the senior dev driving is broken pair programming
- can run into problems that are hard to explain
    - oh yeah, that's where we had to hack "..."
    - yeah, this part isn't documented well, here's what's actually happening

## is there value to the traditional "I do, you do, we do" approach

Yes!

- running the build process
- interacting with the repo
- starting up the debugger
- bouncing the server
- running the test suite

These things follow a specific process that needs to be done correctly. 

## code reviews

- pick the right opportunities
- third-person learning
- ask questions!
- if they don't have questions, force them to come up with something to get dialog going
    - the sooner they feel comfortable in the code base, the sooner they will be productive

## where does experience come from?

time != experience
time + repetition != experience
time + <something> = experience

time + feedback = experience

there are multiple kinds of feedback

- positive
- other kind
    - negative?
    - constructive?
    - growth?

In reality, it comes down to 2:

- useful feedback
    - experience
    - growth
- other kind...
    - stagnation
    - lack of growth
    - demotivating

Feedback should be builing experience

SMART

- Specific
- Meaningful
- Actionable
- Relevant
- Timely

### Examples:

Extend your responses

- "great work on that test script..."
    - "you covered some less obvious corner cases and I can see you thought about how this fits into our automated test suite"

Bad examples:

- "you used the wrong data structure to solve this problem..."
    - maybe they thought it was good enough?
    - maybe they didn't know?

Alternative:

- "a list of objects is a bit heavy of an approach when all we need to do here is..."
    - be more specific!

## ABF - always be feedback...ing

- inaction *is* action
- silence *is* feedback
- checking in only once a week *is* feedback

### bad outcomes

- "well, I guess I'm doing okay..."
- "I'm not really sure about this, but I don't know who to talk to..."
- they ask for feedback, but receive UNSMART feedback (ultimately not SMART)

## being proactive

Ask them:

- what are they working on?
- can they explain the problem?
- what is the proposed solution?
- how are they going to test that it worked?

Make sure you:

- get ahead of issues
- see what issues are developing
- address issues at an opportune time
- prevent future blockers

## non-technical

- if you don't communicate with your junior devs, you might not know when there is a problem until it happens
- help them communicate early and often
- make sure they are on the right track, and always ask if they need help
- get out of the office
- don't make someone pay for feedback (don't make them uncomfortable by making them pay for lunch, coffee, etc...)
- get them talking, the problem will surface if you talk with them enough (they won't always be comfortable talking about struggles)

## first year roller coaster

- they will realize everything isn't perfect (like all companies)
- when they raise concerns, be honest and realistic
- don't encourage them to be jaded though!

#### Scenario: last semester of college

- they want out
- starting first job
- real world hits them...
    - got 2 boring tickets in a row
    - have to write documentation
    - company happy hour scheduled over a personal appointment

### perspective

- honestly celebrate successes
- be honest and realistic when addressing negative conerns as well
- stay involved
- create the culture you want to work in!
    - most of these people won't know what culture is, so now is your chance to show them

### keep learning

- encourage them to keep learning and growing themselves
- avoid dunning-kruger effect
    - people can start to think they know more than they do
    - along the same lines, help to avoid imposter syndrome as well
- create a culture of learning
- computer science is not a mature discipline

When was the last time you got objectively better in your skillset?

#### pursuing knowledge

- even 1-2 hours per week will put you above average
- go to a conference
- follow some choice blogs
- listen to podcasts
- lunch and learns
- community events (talks, happy hours, other social events...)

How can you help?

- encourage them to learn
- encourage them to grow
- set the example!
